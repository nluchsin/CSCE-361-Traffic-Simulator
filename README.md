A Java 1.8.0-based desktop program to simulate a network of cars, roads, and stopsigns. Diagrams are edited with draw.io.

Additionally, the city map may found in the resources folder located in the src repository will be required.

Also, the images of cars contained in the images directory will be needed, and should be included in the project folder in a folder named Images when compiling.
